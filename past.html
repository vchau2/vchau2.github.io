					<h3>3250BC</h3>
					<p>The first tattoos ever discovered were from a Tyrolean Iceman called Ötzi who died around 3250BC. The preserved body was found in Italy preserved in the Ötztal Alps, with 50-60 tattooed markings all over his body. The tattoo designs were mostly sets of lines and simple dots and circles around what would later be compared to acupuncture points. The tattoos were speculated to have been made with pigments from ash, and a sharp object (The Independent). Tattoos are speculated to have been used for medicinal and ceremonial purposes, however tattooing in modern times was mostly regarded as a taboo, social outcast trend amongst prisoners, soldiers, and people on the fringes of society (Tattoos and Body Modification). </p>

					<h3>1891</h3>
					<p>Tattoos have existed in almost every civilization from as far back as 6000 BC, however the electric tattoo machine, invented in 1891 by Samuel L Riley, made tattooing faster and less painful, greatly increasing the popularity and mainstream respect of the art of tattooing. Riley’s machine was modified from Thomas Edison’s patented stencil pen, and used the same rotary system to drive a needle up and down while carrying ink into the dermis layer of the skin. His new patent was for the tube and needle component that created an ink reservoir. This new machine made tattooing faster and less painful, “This led to the first spike in tattooing as a populist trend and set the stage for the beginning of a revolution in the esthetics of tattooing” (Tattoos and Body Modification). The rotary device patented by O’Reilly was not the only machine to come out of the late 1800s; most modern tattoo machines use electromagnetics, which were first developed by Thomas Riley, who patented a single coil machine that used electromagnetics to drive ink up the machine. Riley filed for his patent only 20 days after O’Reilly’s original rotary machine. These machines were often heavy and loud, so a spring was used to take some of the weight off the user’s hand. Tattoo designs would thusly become more highly regarded as an art form and less associated with social deviancy. </p>
