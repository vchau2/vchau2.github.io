					<h3>The Modern Machine</h3>
					<p>There are several types of modern tattoos machines, including the first two mentioned previously (the rotary machine and the coil machine) which are the most popular. There are also liner machines, used for creating single dominate lines, shader machines, for low saturation shading with black shades, and the pneumatic tattoo machine, which is powered by an air compressor. The design of the popular and original machine consists of the main “gun” which holds the rotary system and connects to a power source, a needle that is connected to the top of the machine and threaded through, and a tube which surrounds the needle and hovers just above the skin in use. The tube and needle are replaced with every person for sterilization. (Hubtattoo)</p>

					<p>The phycology of modern tattooing is still being studied and debated, with people analyzing why people decide to have themselves tattooed. Some psychological studies have “a tendency to conceptualize tattoos within frameworks of deviant behavior, risk-taking, and antisocial tendencies” however there are different types of research that “examines how tattoos relate to social scientific variables such as gender, social class, sexuality, and sense of self-identity” (Tattooing and Body Modification).</p>
