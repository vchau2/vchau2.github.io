      <h2>Blog Post One</h2>
      <p>Positives: I think the designer, Isaac, does a really great job at showing his personality in his work, and it makes me want to get to know him and look more into his projects. He organizes his work from most general to then more specific as you scroll deeper or click on more things which really provides a sense of hierarchy. Secondly the imagery—especially the first gif of moving websites that he has worked on—is really engaging and shows that he put in the extra effort to make that animation of his work. Lastly the website was extremely easy to use and understand, the pages are formatted on the first opening page as an endless scroll, but then there is also a top navigation bar that corresponds to the different sections you scroll through; a really easy, yet interesting and original format.</p>
      <p>Critiques: The designer uses a really informal language, for example he titles sections “I make stuff” and “talk to me” which may scare off some more formal potential employers; however, I think he is doing this on purpose because his work is so expressive and personal that he wouldn’t be looking for serious, no-fun projects. He uses a very wide color palette along with the colors of all his projects featured on the site, so the colors and big blocks of colored pages sometimes feels a little random. Lastly, I wish there was some initial indication that the site is a portfolio; at first I thought that the site may have been for a firm of multiple people, or a design blog.</p>

      <h2>Blog Post Two</h2>
      <p>My biggest issue with making the roaster’s page was that I had forgotten to close some of the lines of code and my page came out really messed up. I tried looking back at the code and then couldn’t figure out what the issue was, or which page (the css or the html) had the issue. I think because the solution was so simple I couldn’t figure it out. Andy the TA helped me out and reminded me to close each thing as a open it so that issue won’t happen to me. Also he showed me the trick of going into the page in chrome and “inspecting” it to find issues and that was also a great tool.
      </p>
      <p>One of the surprisingly easy things was linking the roaster’s page to the navigation of the main page; all I had to do was plug the link of the new page into the place holding quotes of the navigation on the original html. Also, having consistent and clear naming conventions on the images and the different pages made things easier to link back and make sure my images showed up. In the future I think my biggest thing to remember is the close things as a open them so that I don’t forget later. Overall thought css was pretty intuitive and I look forward to seeing what it can do.

      <h2>Blog Post Three</h2>
      <p> list apart article: Why aren’t you asking questions? </p>
      <p>This article initially interested me because I have also noticed that design students—myself include—shy away from asking questions during class and critiques. I knew that it was important to be asking questions when talking to a client, but this article focused on ways to be more constructive and be an active participant during group projects and when talking to clients who aren’t necessarily skilled in design. I have been in situations before when I was the only designer working on a team, and it is a different situation that is tougher to communicate your ideas in, compared to working with other design students.
      </p>
      <p>In terms of web design and working with code, the section of the article that talked about the importance of understanding the audience of your work is most applicable. When doing work for a client, its common for your client to not necessarily be part of the intended audience of the website, so its really important to be asking questions about not only what the client needs, but what the indented audience also needs. The audience is really important for designing a website’s navigation, and making sure it is particularly user-friendly for the intended us and user.
      </p>
      <p>One of the more difficult things to understand in the article was the concept of “reading between the lines” when asking clients questions. I think it would be hard to both work with and trust your client, but also be constantly asking yourself if your client is answering and asking the right questions to find the right solution. Also, I when you are the designer and they are the client, you are not just a part of the team, you are also the only person responsible for making sure design principles and basically the overall design is a good one, so you are looking to get certain cues out of the conversation that others may be less concerned with.

        <h2>Blog Post Four</h2>
        <p>The website I chose was Design Made in Germany.</p>
        <p>The website is written in German, but I can still see the really clear hierarchy of type and imagery. I think my favorite platform of the site is the normal desktop version, because I love the full illustrations and the subtle details. The website has almost a splash page effect because the first and only page is just imagery and a tittle, and then when you scroll down you are taken to an introduction and then an index with a navigation bar. This is also a really great way to layout a website on mobile because endless scroll is an easier way to move around instead of having to click on things. I wish on mobile you could still see the great illustrations and imagery, but it is mostly just type. The color scheme is really nice for the full website on desktop, but when there is less of a visual impact on the smaller screens it’s a little underwhelming.</p>
        <p>I really like the scrolling format overall, it is used in every version. It’s a really effortless way to navigate, while still being able to jump around the page using the navigation bar that is always present. I think the imagery to this website is really important and I would really like to make sure the imagery I use in the future is strong because it’s the first thing that attracted me to this website in the first place.</p>
