      <h2>Blog Post One</h2>
      <p>Positives: I think the designer, Isaac, does a really great job at showing his personality in his work, and it makes me want to get to know him and look more into his projects. He organizes his work from most general to then more specific as you scroll deeper or click on more things which really provides a sense of hierarchy. Secondly the imagery—especially the first gif of moving websites that he has worked on—is really engaging and shows that he put in the extra effort to make that animation of his work. Lastly the website was extremely easy to use and understand, the pages are formatted on the first opening page as an endless scroll, but then there is also a top navigation bar that corresponds to the different sections you scroll through; a really easy, yet interesting and original format.</p>
      <p>Critiques: The designer uses a really informal language, for example he titles sections “I make stuff” and “talk to me” which may scare off some more formal potential employers; however, I think he is doing this on purpose because his work is so expressive and personal that he wouldn’t be looking for serious, no-fun projects. He uses a very wide color palette along with the colors of all his projects featured on the site, so the colors and big blocks of colored pages sometimes feels a little random. Lastly, I wish there was some initial indication that the site is a portfolio; at first I thought that the site may have been for a firm of multiple people, or a design blog.</p>

      <h2>Blog Post Two</h2>
      <p>My biggest issue with making the roaster’s page was that I had forgotten to close some of the lines of code and my page came out really messed up. I tried looking back at the code and then couldn’t figure out what the issue was, or which page (the css or the html) had the issue. I think because the solution was so simple I couldn’t figure it out. Andy the TA helped me out and reminded me to close each thing as a open it so that issue won’t happen to me. Also he showed me the trick of going into the page in chrome and “inspecting” it to find issues and that was also a great tool.
      </p>
      <p>One of the surprisingly easy things was linking the roaster’s page to the navigation of the main page; all I had to do was plug the link of the new page into the place holding quotes of the navigation on the original html. Also, having consistent and clear naming conventions on the images and the different pages made things easier to link back and make sure my images showed up. In the future I think my biggest thing to remember is the close things as a open them so that I don’t forget later. Overall thought css was pretty intuitive and I look forward to seeing what it can do.
