					<p>The electric tattoo machine, invented in 1891 by Samuel L Riley, made tattooing faster and less painful, greatly increasing the popularity and mainstream respect of the art of tattooing. Riley’s machine was modified from Thomas Edison’s patented stencil pen, and used the same rotary system to drive a needle up and down while carrying ink into the dermis layer of the skin. There are now several types of modern machines, however the rotary machine derived from Riley’s patent are still very popular. The machine consists of the main “gun” which holds the rotary system and connects to a power source, a needle that is connected to the top of the machine and threaded through, and a tube which surrounds the needle and hovers just above the skin in use. The tube and needle are replaced with every person for sterilization. (Hubtattoo).</p>
					<p>Before the invention of the tattoo gun, tattoos existed as far back as 6000 BC. Tattoos were first used for medicinal and ceremonious purposes, and then were widely regarded for social outcasts and deviants from mainstream society. It was not until the tattoo machine was invented that tattooing was regarded as an art, and began to make its way out of taboo pockets of society. Now, tattooing phycology is still being debated with studies formed about college students and people in institutions, however the aesthetics of tattoo designs have evolved to be a respected fine art (Tattoos and Body Modification). The future of tattooing will most likely take the form of new technology, incorporating wearable technology like tattooed microphones, scan-able tattoos, and sensors. (Wired Magazine).</p>
